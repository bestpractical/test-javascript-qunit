This is a very trivial harness around qunit which, with a bit of setup
allows you to use tools built for TAP (the Test Anything Protocol)
and the Perl testing toolchain to run a QUnit test suite from the unix
commandline.

To make it go, you'll want to include the "qunit-tap.js" Javascript in your
QUnit test harness index.html just after you include "qunit.js".

You'll need to take the bin/qunit_harness.pl and tweak it to know where to find your QUnit test suite. 

You'll probably also need to configure how it launches the  harnessed web browser. 

Patches are most certainly welcome.
